Sprint 1 Tema 5
Task 1. We need to create a type of data that represents an animal. Animals have a name, however, the sound of the “talk” of a dog is not the same as that of a cat. Therefore, we need to create other types of data that help us program these behaviors. Basically, we want a makeSound() method that shows a different message if it is a dog (for example, “Bup, bup!”) or a cat (for example “Me!”).
